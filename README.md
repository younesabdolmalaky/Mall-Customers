# Mall-Customers
## About this Dataset
### Context
This data set is created only for the learning purpose of the customer segmentation concepts , also known as market basket analysis . I will demonstrate this by using unsupervised ML technique (KMeans Clustering Algorithm) in the simplest form.

### Content
You are owing a supermarket mall and through membership cards , you have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score.
Spending Score is something you assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.

### The criteria used to measure the performance of clusters:

#### Inertia:
Inertia measures how well a dataset was clustered by K-Means. It is calculated by measuring the distance between each data point and its centroid, squaring this distance, and summing these squares across one cluster. A good model is one with low inertia AND a low number of clusters ( K ).
#### Silhouette :
Silhouette Coefficient or silhouette score is a metric used to calculate the goodness of a clustering technique. Its value ranges from -1 to 1. 1: Means clusters are well apart from each other and clearly distinguished
#### Data visualization : 
Due to the small dimensions, the features can be visualized and the performance of the clusters can be seen with the eyes
